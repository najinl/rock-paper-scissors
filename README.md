## Project Overview
The project entails building a rock, paper, scissors game with two different game modes: classic and difficult. The players include you (the human) and the computer. Scores for each of the players will persist on the left and right side of the page, wheras the main player board (or central area on the application) is constantly changing. Once a player selects a game mode, the characters (or fighters) that the human can select from are displayed. Once the human player chooses a fighter the screen changes to show the human fighter selection next to the computer fighter selection and the winner of the round at the top of the page. The score card of the winner will change to include an additional win point. At any point during the game there is a button under the human score card information that will allow for the human to return to the main page and switch game modes. Local storage was implemented in this project to allow for the scores to carry over each time the game mode is switched and upon refresh of the page.

## Learning Goals
The goals of this project were to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of local storage to persist data
- Utilize DRY JavaScript
- Employ event delegation
- Display an understanding of the difference       between the Data Model and the DOM.  

## Web App Attributes
- User is greated swith a home screen, which shows their user token, name, and a beginning score of 0 wins on the right hand side of the page. The middle of the page has a prompt for the user to select a game mode: classic or difficult. When the user hovers over the game mode, it will be highlighted in white and the text will turn dark pink.
