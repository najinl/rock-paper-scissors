## Project Overview
The project entails building a rock, paper, scissors game with two different game modes: classic and difficult. The players include you (the human) and the computer. Scores for each of the players will persist on the left and right side of the page, wheras the main player board (or central area on the application) is constantly changing. Once a player selects a game mode, the characters (or fighters) that the human can select from are displayed. Once the human player chooses a fighter the screen changes to show the human fighter selection next to the computer fighter selection and the winner of the round at the top of the page. The score card of the winner will change to include an additional win point. At any point after the first play of a game mode a button under the human score card information that will allow for the human to return to the main page and switch game modes will be visible. Local storage was implemented in this project to allow for the scores to carry over each time the game mode is switched and upon refresh of the page.

## Learning Goals
The goals of this project were to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of local storage to persist data
- Utilize DRY JavaScript
- Employ event delegation
- Display an understanding of the difference between the Data Model and the DOM.  

## Code Architecture
- The application's data model consist of four .js files.

  **player.js:** this is the class constructor for both the computer player and the human player. It includes only three methods, one that allows a player to take a      turn and assigns to that turn to the playChoice property, another that saves the win tally for a player to local storage and another to retrieve those play          wins.
  
  **game.js:** this is the class constructor for a new game. Within this class constructur, two instances of player are instantiated (one for the human player and        one for the computer). Additionally, this js file has a method that starts a game based off of a mode selected by the mode the human player chooses (this is        done utilizing a query selector's target on an id within the DOM, which is then passed into the method as the argument of "mode"). Within this same method the      playerChoices property is populated with the array of possible fighters (or characters, which are located within the data.js file) and who they win against          and lose against based off of the game mode selected. The generateCoputerPlay method then chooses a random index of this array (now located within                  playerChoices) and selects this as the computer's play/fighter. The determineWinner method then checks to see if the human player choice/figher is included in      the win against or lose against property of the playerChoices property within the game class. Within this same method wins for the appropriate player are            incremented if they win and the winner property is updated to include the name ofthe winner. Finally, the wins for both players are saved to local storage.
  
  **data.js:** this file includes the classic characters and difficult characters' arrays. Within these arrays is an object that represents each possible                fighter/player choice ("type") and two additional properties--one that contains all the winners against that fighter and one for all of the losers. This            reduces the lengthy if/if else statements that would be required to capture the logic of all possible win/lose cases.
  
  **main.js:** this file contains an instanciation of a the game class called newGame, which allows the main.js file to have access to all of the methods within          both the player.js and game.js files. There are 16 global variables that serve as query selectors within this file. Two global variables, classAddForHuman and      classAddForComputer, are utilized to update the DOM with only the image of the fighter that the human and computer chose during each round right before the          time out happens and the gameboard is reset. There are two helper functions used within the file--one for adding classes and one for removing classes.              Additionally, there are two wrapper functions that encase these helper functions. The remainder of functions within the file are used to update the DOM with        messages to the player and/or resetting the gameboard.
  
## Challenges
- Embedded img tags seemed to not do so great when it came to sizing them, so I ended up embedding the fighters/characters as background-image url's. I consider this a challenge, because I'm not sure that it is appropriate to do so and then just stick an "alt" within the button element and this still be considered semantic and/or appropriate for visually impaired users.

- Feel like the rubric requiring us to put the saveWinsToStorage and retrieveWinsFromStorage lead to me utilizing a lot of chaining within the main.js file within on load event listener...didn't know what else to do though.

- Even though I refactored the addCharacterOptions function by clumping a lot of functions into the wrapper showSelectedAndDeclareWinner...I still have heartache about the wrapper maybe doing too many things at once? Again, at a loss for a better way.

## Wins
- I was really proud of the data.js file's arrays and how this made the logic behind determining a winner so much cleaner!
- I'm proud of my addClass and removeClass helpers. Although I know it is a simple function, I wanted to do something like this in intention timer...but got too far down the path to implement it later on. Just happy I did it hereðŸ˜†


## Web App Attributes
- User is greated swith a home screen, which shows their user token, name, and a beginning score of 0 wins on the right hand side of the page. The middle of the page has a prompt for the user to select a game mode: classic or difficult. When the user hovers over the game mode, it will be highlighted in white and the text will turn dark pink.

- Once user selects a game mode, the gameboard section will be populated with fighter (or character) choices for the human to play. The prompt for choosing a game mode will change to "choose your fighter". The human can see that they are able to select their choice of fighter by clicking the fighter image, because when they hover over fighters their cursor turns into a hand. Once the the human selects their fighter the gameboard screen will change to only show their fighter selection and the computer's fighter selection side by side (adjacent to the player card who selected them). Additionally, a button under the human player win value on the left side of the screen will appear that allows the player to change game modes. The prompt for the player to "choose your fighter" will change to indicate who won the round or if it was a tie.

- Once the player clicks the "Change Game?" button, they will be taken back to the home screen where they are again prompted to "Choose your game!". If difficult mode is selected, then the player selection is then updated with not three, BUT FIVE fighter options for the human to player to select from. The computer and human selections will show side by side, just the same as they did in classic mode, after the human play is selected. A timeout will automatically reset the gameboard so that all fighters are selectable 1s after each round. Best part of all of this is that the game wins will carry from game mode to game mode no matter how many times the player switches modes (God bless you local storage).
